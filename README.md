# Hyperpolyglot

Once you know one programming language, learning the 2nd or 3rd is easier if you compare it side-by-side.

This project aims to compare the most used languages side-by-side: JavaScript, Python, Java (pending), and C++ (pending).

Features roadmap:

- [ ] Complete coverage for JS and PY with their main data structures (Arrays, Strings, Stack, Queues, Heaps, etc.)
- [ ] Add Java and C++
- [ ] Code and text search
- [ ] Columns reordering
- [ ] Pick columns

## Which Programming Language is better?

Many people ask these questions; the correct answer is: it depends. 

It depends on your application. If you want to do machine learning or data science, probably, Python would be a good choice because it has many libraries already for that. Do you need graphics or video rendering application? Maybe C++ would be better for that.

Even though you can achieve the same results with many programming languages, there is some critical difference. Not only the syntax is different (or similar) but also:
- Speed (Some are blazing fast like C++, others are slower like Python)
- Libraries and community (some have many libraries for the web like JavaScript, others have utilities for big data technologies like Java)
